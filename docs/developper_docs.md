## How to Release Kubervisor

This project is using [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) and an additional script for releasing also the Helm chart.

For starting the delivery, you need to clone this repository, then:

```console
zsh hack/release.sh <version> <remove-git>
```

a concreate example is: ```zsh ./hack/release.sh v1.0.1 upstream```

This script:

- generates locally the helm chart with the requested version.
- updates the helm repo index file (```index.yaml```) file with the new release.
- creates a new changeset with all changes generated by the new release version, then tag this changeset.
- push changeset and associated tag to the remote git repository.
